Ballon-game android demo
==============

Based on fork of source code for the Begin programming: build your first mobile game course from the University of Reading

I modified the original code to add physics, graphics and new sprites into the game, to re-imagine it as a ballon bouncing game. The basic physics are in, but still to add a scoring mechanism.

The prebuilt .apk to install it on your Android phone can be found [here](http://www.ryzdev.uk/resources/BalloonGame.apk)
