Ballon-game android demo
==============

Based on a fork of the source code from FutureLearn course "Begin programming: build your first mobile game" from the University of Reading.

I modified the original code to add physics, graphics and new sprites into the game, to re-imagine it as a ballon bouncing game. The basic physics are in, but still to add a scoring mechanism.
