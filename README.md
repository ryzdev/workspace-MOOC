A.I. Pong
=======

Based on a fork of the source code from FutureLearn course "Begin programming: build your first mobile game" from the University of Reading.

Modified the original Breakout-style block breaking game to turn it into a Pong clone with AI opponent, with improved physics and retro graphics. A work in progress, as yet still not finished.
